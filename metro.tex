Dear Mrs. Katharina Poschen,

As a mathematics researcher in FSU Jena and with over four years experience as research employee and several years of cooperation in related fields such as economics and urban planing, I feel that I am an excellent fit for this position.


%?I am writing to express my interest in spending an internship with Metro AG in strategic research? I am currently doing the last steps of doctorate in Mathematics of FSU Jena Germany I have four years experience as research employee and five years teaching experience as well as several years of cooperation with experts in other fields including economists and urban planners.

I have done several courses in Statistical Inference, Operations Research, Exploratory Data Analysis and Big Data Analysis which helped me to learn basis of \textbf{Intelligence Analysis} techniques such as: XXXXX, XXXX, XXXXX. Moreover, in terms of working experience, I have cooperated with economists to study financial derivatives with aim of understanding their relationship with gambling. Furthermore, together with urban planners I developed an algorithm for hospital facility location in Tehran (Capital of Iran) exploiting big graphs.


% I am already expert in MS Office, intermediate in R and familiar with python and MatLab. Some works of mine are available in my  \href{https://github.com/srhumir}{\textcolor{blue}{\underline{github page}}}. 



%Through which I gained experience in spatial analysis especially working with ArcGIS software package. I also am familiar with, by nature statistical, techniques of remote sensing, and help urban planners running them through R programming.

As a mathematician, my background helps me to be able to focus on details and be able to understand complicated problems. I have good analytical thinking and problem solving skills and my teaching experiences also helps me to be able to break sophisticated concepts to some small and understandable pieces and present them in a proper way to none-technical people. Moreover, I have cooperated with different teams with diverse skills and I have a great teamwork spirit.

% As my CV illustrates, I have a broad range of computer and Internet skills which make me able to handle all the daily and office works.

After several years of doing academic research and gaining a lot of theoretical knowledge, my vision for undertaking this position is to become able to use my theoretical knowledge in practical projects and I believe that working in such a professional team in a supreme corporation like Metro is a great opportunity to get real work experience for a new career. I am confident in my abilities and believe that working in your group will result in significant advancement of my skills. I should mention that I have German work permit and am ready to start as soon as desired.
