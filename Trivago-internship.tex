After several years of mainly doing academic jobs a a  master holder of mathematics, I would like to move into a more practical yet analytical and active sector. I have done several years of study, research as well as teaching. Alongside I cooperated with experts in other areas, including economics  and financial mathematics, by mainly studying Financial "Derivatives`` and designing data bank. I also cooperated with Urban planners for developing quantitative methods and relevant algorithms in order to analyse various parameters in cities in which I gained experience working with big graphs, designing algorithms and programming. Plus I  applied remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques which are again closely related to statistical problem solving and needed programming in R and Python.

As a mathematician, I am good in analysing and creative problem solving. I have experience in algorithm developing and programming, including Python. Thereby I can find the causes of problems by analysing the situation in detail. As well I past courses with great grades in SQL and data analysis.

I taught complicated mathematical topics to students of various educational backgrounds, during which you need to be especially friendly, understanding and patient and at the same time you need to be able to explain complex concepts in an understandable way.  
I am very comfortable working with Spreadsheets and other Office software plus typesetting in Latex. 

Most of abilities mentioned above are gained independently which proves my high ability of learning new materials. I can work independently but am also able working in groups, specially from different backgrounds.

Working in a competitive and fast moving team in a creative company like trivago is interesting. Considering my good familiarity in IT and strong ability to analyse and learn, I see myself as a good candidate for this position.

I already have a work permit in Germany and am ready to start as soon as desired and  looking forward to meet you at your first convenience.
