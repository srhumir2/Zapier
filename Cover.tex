After several years of mainly doing academic jobs a a  master holder of mathematics, I would like to move into some more practical yet analytical and active sector. I have done several years of study, research as well as teaching. Alongside I cooperated with experts in other areas, including economics  and financial mathematics, by mainly studying ''Financial "Derivatives`` and designing data bank for their scientific papers. I also cooperated with Urban planners for developing quantitative methods and relevant algorithms in order to analyse various parameters in cities, plus applying remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques.

As a mathematician, I am good in analysing and creative problem solving. I have experience in algorithm developing and programming, including Python. I am  also familiar with data banks. Thereby I can find the causes of problems by analysing the situation in detail.
I taught complicated mathematical topics to students of various educational backgrounds, during which you need to be especially friendly, undersanding and patient and at the same time you need to be able to explain complex concepts in an understandable way.  
I am very comfortable working with Spreadsheets and other Office software plus typesetting in Latex. 

Most of abilities mentioned above are gained independently which proves my high ability of learning new materials. I can work independently but am also able working in groups, specially from different backgrounds.

Working with large amount of data and finding desired information from it is a challenge which I found interesting and desirable. I would like to work in a BI team with a great combination of areas of expertise, and even ages and nationalities, in a leading and creative company like trivago.

I am ready to start as soon as desired and  looking forward to meet you at your first convenience.
