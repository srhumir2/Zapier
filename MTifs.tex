I am writing to apply for the position "Junior Consultants \& Business Analysten" in which I found exploring Jobb\"orse.

After several years of mainly doing academic jobs, I would like to move in to some more practical yet analytical and active sector. I have done several years of research, managing classes and at the same time doing  cooperation with third parties, including economists, which required data analyzing, problem solving even developing methods and programming. So I believe this position a perfect fit to my qualifications and interests.

I have studied and done research in Mathematics which in nature needs excessive analysis and problem solving. Alongside I have done cooperation with experts in other areas. Including economics experts in financial mathematics. Mainly studying financial "Derivatives" plus designing data bank for their scientific papers. Urban planners for developing quantitative methods and developing relevant algorithms to analyse various parameters in cities. And helping in running remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques.

Risk management in nature requires analysing data and forecasting patterns. And developing instruments for it requires understanding the math behind it. And these are the things I am good at and willing to do. 

I appreciate your time and consideration and am looking forward to meet you at your first convenience. I am reachable through above mentioned email address and cell number.
