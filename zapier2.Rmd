Dear 

I am writing to express my interest to do data scientist internship with Zapier. I am currently doing the last steps of doctorate in Mathematics in FSU Jena Germany. I have four years experience as research employee and my research is about representation of algebraic groups. Also I have five years teaching experience plus several years of cooperation with experts in other fields including urban planners and economists.

Now after several years of mainly doing academic jobs, I would like to enter into a more practical yet active sector and found the data analysis really interesting and perfectly fitted to my theoretical background. I did several courses in Statistics, Statistical inference, Operational Research, Exploratory Data Analysis,  Machine learning, Introduction to Big Data, Programming and Data structures as well as data banks. Through these courses, I got familiar with randomized control trials, bootstrapping, parametric analysis with various distribution, Hadoop, SQL etc. I am already intermediate in R and familiar with python with interest in learning them more deeply. Some works of mine are available in my [github page](https://github.com/srhumir).

In terms of working experience, I have thought various topics of mathematics from abstract algebra to differential equations and analysis. I also cooperated with urban planners to develop an algorithm for assessing accessibility in cities using big graphs and I programmed it in MatLab. Through which I gained experience in spatial analysis especially working with ArcGIS software package. I also am familiar with, by nature statistical, techniques of remote sensing, and help urban planners running them through R programming. Furthermore, with economists, we studied financial derivatives with aim of understanding their nature and their relationship with gambling.

In terms of transferable skills, I learned how to translate real world problems into mathematical statements and vice versa while cooperating with other professions as well as math work. I am confident in my analyzing and problem solving abilities as key skills in mathematics. I did cooperated in teams with diverse skills. Also for several years I thought mathematics to students of various scientific and social backgrounds through which you have to be enormously patient, friendly and understanding as well as being able to express complicated problems in understandable manners. Last but not least, I am an independent fast leaner and capable of finding the best way the jobs are done using available resources.

In R I found the "dplyr"" and "data.table" packages interesting for their fast and efficient capability of cleaning and summarizing the data. "raster" is a very nice package for working with grid data. For plotting one should not underestimate the base plotting system of R but whenever it is too much code consuming, I prefer to use "ggplot2"."caret" is a terrific package gathering machine learning techniques and whatever preprocessing needed in one place. "Rmarkdown" in combination with LaTex is a great tool for making reports. 


Working with the interesting, creative and creditable Zapier is a huge opportunity to earn invaluable experiment and credit for my career prospect. So I would like to spend a two to three-month remote internship. I was wondering if there is a possibility of doing a two to three-month remote internship by Zapier. 

Enclosed please find my resume and here are the reports of two selected works of mine on 

1. [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/srhumir/Storm-Analysis)

2. [Machine learning](https://github.com/srhumir/Weight-Lifting-Exercises)


With highest regards
