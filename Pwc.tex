I am writing to apply for the position ''Praktikant Versicherungsmathematik'' with Jobcode ''A-8051'' which I found exploring stepstone websit for job vacancies.

After several years of mainly doing academic jobs, I would like to move into some more practical yet analytical and active sector. I have done several years of research, managing classes and at the same time doing  cooperation with third parties which required data analyzing, spatial analysing, problem solving even developing methods and programming. So I believe this position a perfect fit to my qualifications and interests.

I have studied and researched in Mathematics which in nature needs excessive analysis and problem solving. Alongside I have done cooperation with experts in other areas. Including economics experts in financial mathematics and Urban planners in developing quantitative methods and  relevant algorithms to analyse various parameters in cities.

In insurance there are good job opportunities for mathematicians and gathering experience in PricewaterhouseCoopers as a leading organisation with considerable size would be a great start. I am ready to start at your first convenience.

 I appreciate your time and consideration and am looking forward to meet you as your first convinience. I am reachable through abovely mensioned email address and cell number.
